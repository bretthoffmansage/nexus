 * P5.1 — single readiness source for every P5 private (owner-scoped) Convex
 * query and mutation.
 *
 * Clerk reporting a signed-in user and Convex confirming an auth token are
 * NOT the same moment: Clerk's client state can be "signed in" before the
 * Convex WebSocket has finished exchanging and validating the session token.
 * Issuing an owner-scoped query in that gap causes the backend's (correct)
 * `unauthenticated` rejection. `readyForPrivateQueries` is the only signal
 * components should use to decide whether to run a protected query/mutation.
 *
 * Wraps Convex's own `useConvexAuth()` — the authoritative signal for whether
 * the Convex client currently has a confirmed auth token. Convex remains the
 * sole authentication authority; this hook adds no separate readiness state
 * of its own. Like the sibling `useQuery`/`useMutation` calls already used
 * throughout the P5 components, this requires a `ConvexProviderWithAuth`-
 * family provider (e.g. `ConvexProviderWithClerk`) above it in the tree,
 * which every page that renders these components mounts.
